I am a final year MPhys: Physics student at the University of Manchester. My masters project 

I am intersted in foundational models inspired by problems rooted in the natural sciences and the broader AI4Science in general. 

I have worked on applying equivaraince and graph neural networks to drug discovery, digital histopathalogy and radio astronomy. I have also worked on applications of deep learning to near-term weather forecasting.
