I am currently working at the intersection of combinatorial optimisers and graph neural networks applied to the upcoming Square Kilometer Array at the JBCA, supervised by <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/anna-scaife" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Anna Scaife</a>.</p> <p>My interest spans across different areas of deep learning, with the aims of</p> <ul> <li>Creating new foundational models inspired by problems rooted in the natural sciences</li> <li>Applying these models to build better models for Weather Predictions, Climate Change, Material and Drug discovery.</li> </ul> <p>Throughout my degree, I have had the good fortune to work on many intersting machine learning problems. I completed an internship with <a href="https://people.epfl.ch/dorina.thanou?lang=en" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr Dorina Thanou</a> (summer 2023) at EPFL. Prior to this I worked as a research intern with <a href="https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~teh/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Professor Yee Whye Teh</a> (summer 2022) at the University of Oxford. I have also worked on applications of deep learning to near-term cloud forecasting and represented my university in the inaugral <a href="https://climatehack.ai/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ClimateHack</a>.
